# Mobility-in-US-Cities
Project exploring the mobility patterns in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. The work leverages GPS point data scraped from cellphone/device applications. The works focuses on pattern detection and comparison across cities, network topology of mobility networks through clustering, and node-edge volume/mode prediction using machine learning.
